# Public Assets

Static assets copied directly to dist/ with no processing. Organize into logical folders.

## Organization

- `public/images/` - Image assets
- `public/fonts/` - Font files
- `public/` - Other static assets

## Guidelines

- Assets are copied as-is to dist/
- No build-time processing
- Organize into meaningful subdirectories
- Reference in development as `/<filename>` (no 'public' prefix needed)
