# TypeScript/JavaScript Modules

Component-specific scripts go in `src/js/components/`. Keep modules isolated with no bundler-only imports.

## File Organization

```
src/js/components/modal.ts
```

## Guidelines

- Place component scripts in `src/js/components/`
- Keep modules isolated and modular
- Avoid bundler-only patterns
- Use effective TypeScript for library-style code
- Maintain clean module boundaries
