# Figma Integration

For Figma MCP integration, component and page file names should match Figma node/component names for proper mapping.

## Design-to-Dev Workflow

- Component/page file names should match Figma node names
- Follow Static Kit conventions when generating from Figma designs
- Maintain consistent naming between design and code
- Use proper file placement per Static Kit rules

## Guidelines

- Generate HTML/SCSS from Figma following Static Kit conventions
- Ensure proper file placement in src/ directories
- Maintain design-code consistency through naming
