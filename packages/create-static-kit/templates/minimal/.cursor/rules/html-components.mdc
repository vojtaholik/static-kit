# HTML Components

Reusable HTML components should follow specific naming and structure conventions.

## File Naming

- Use lowercase kebab-case for file names
- Examples: `button.html`, `ui/card.html`

## Structure Rules

- No `<html>` or `<body>` tags in components
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Place under `src/components/` directory

## Import Usage

Components should be imported using `@components/` prefix in pages.
